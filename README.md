Blackjack Game in Python
========================

This is a simple game of blackjack made to practice my Python skills.
It is played with a player and an AI dealer.

How to play
-----------
1. Player starts with $500 and places a bet.
2. Player and dealer each recieve 2 cards from a standard 52-card deck. One of the dealer's cards is face down and hidden from the player.
3. The player chooses to hit or stay.
4. If the player hits they will be dealt a card from the top of the deck. If they're at or under 21 they can choose to hit or stay again. Otherwise they lose.
5. If the player stays the dealer will hit until they are at 17 or higher. If they score higher than the player, the player loses. If they are less than the player or they bust, the player wins.
6. After the game the player will either have their bet added to (or deducted from) their total, and given the option to walk away or play again. If they lose all their money they must quit.
